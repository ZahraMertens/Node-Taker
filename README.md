## User Story

AS A small business owner I WANT to be able to write and save notes SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Actual Behaviour

* WHEN I open the Note Taker THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

* WHEN I click on the Save icon THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

* WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column


## Bonus
