## Task Description

The App is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user can clone the repository and by simply answering prompts in the terminal, a polished html page gets generated which provides position related information.
As TDD (Test-Driven-Development) is an essentail part in web development to maintain code there are unit tests for ever part of the code.

## User Story

AS A manager, I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Actual Behaviour

* WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

* WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

* WHEN I click on the GitHub username THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

* WHEN I start the application THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

* WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

* WHEN I select the engineer option THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

* WHEN I select the intern option THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

* WHEN I decide to finish building my team THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated


## Bonus

* 🏆 WHEN I start the application THEN I have to enter my Teams name which will be the individual header of the webpage

* 🏆 WHEN I start the application THEN I am presented with a welcome message
